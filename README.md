# GSheet to GForm Quiz Creator
This project does only one thing: it takes a Google Sheet with questions in the format:
- Question
- Question type
- Answers
- Answer
- Required
- Points

And turns the content below that header into multiple Google Forms configured as quizzes.

The Forms are saved on the users GDrive in a folder named after the quiz. A single HTML file is also created that lists the URL to the actual functional submittable quizzes.

I can't get the icon to appear as I don't have a public place where I can put it. Sigh.
